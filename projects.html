        <p>
          This was part of a SheCodes challenge, to use my skills to showcase a
          memorable travel destination. I chose Alaska, where I was lucky enough
          to spend my honeymoon. Check out my fully responsive website, my
          following the links, or clicking the image!

          This was part of a SheCodes project, to use React and API's. Enter any
          word and recieve the definition and pictures! I found react
          challenging, but I learned a lot and look forward to progressing in
          the future with this language.

          Using AI has been a really fun part of the SheCodes diploma. I created
          this website as part of a final project. The brief was to create a
          webpage using AI, to return a recipe, poem, song, or similar! I chose
          to do a healthy smoothie recipe, as I love them!

          I designed and built this website for Malini at Affinity Therapy
          Purley. This is one of the first websites that I have that I had the
          pleasure of both desigining and building. Malini's business has a
          really strong brand, which I was able to replicate through the
          website.

        <p>
          I designed and built this website as part of SheCodes homework. The
          website had to be about something I was passionate about, including
          grids, header, hero, images, footer and fully responsive. I then had
          to publish the website through GitHub and Netlify.

        <p>
          I designed this website as part of a SheCodes monthly challenge.
          Rather than just choose a quote to display, I decided to make the
          website interactive, requiring the user to enter their name, to
          recieve a personalised quote. Why not have a go youself?

          This is a worldwide clock, which I designed and built myself. This

          I designed this website as part of my SheCodes homework. The website
          is linked to live data, giving up to date information around worldwide

          experience!

        <p>
          I designed this website for Beccie Dunn back in 2021, long before I
          started to code myself. <br />She wanted the website to really reflect
          her strength, resilience and positivity.
